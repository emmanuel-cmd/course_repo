        O Lord my God,
        <br>When I in awesome wonder
        <br>Consider all
        <br>The works Thy Hand hath made,
        <br>I see the stars,
        <br>I hear the mighty thunder,
        <br>Thy pow'r throughout
        <br>The universe displayed,
        <br>When through the woods
        <br>And forest glades I wander
        <br>I hear the birds
        <br>Sing sweetly in the trees,
        <br>When I look down
        <br>From lofty mountain grandeur
        <br>And hear the brook
        <br>And feel the gentle breeze,
        <br>Then sings my soul,
        <br>My Savior God, to Thee,
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>Then sings my soul,
        <br>My Savior God, to Thee,
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>When Christ shall come,
        <br>With shouts of acclamation,
        <br>And take me home,
        <br>What joy shall fill my heart!
        <br>Then I shall bow
        <br>In humble adoration
        <br>And there proclaim,
        <br>"My God, how great Thou art!"
        <br>Then sings my soul,
        <br>My Savior God, to Thee,
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>Then sings my soul,
        <br>My Savior God, to Thee,
        <br>How great Thou art!
        <br>How great Thou art!

      <p>Give Your Life to Jesus

        <br>Come hear the call...come hear Him call...

        <br>Each day when y open my eyes, I'm thankful all over again
        <br>As I reach for Your Word learning stories about my friend
        <br>For God the Father so loved this world
        <br>He gave you the gift of His Son
        <br>That whosoever believes in Him
        <br>Will be the victorious one

        <br>When you give your life to Jesus, You'll never be walking alone
        <br>When you give your life to Jesus
        <br>You've found the way, and Heaven forever is home

        <br>Come hear the call...come hear Him call...

        <br>Some try to say there's a better life
        <br>And how I'm a fool to believe
        <br>But I'll carry the cross
        <br>With His heart out on my sleeve
        <br>How I pray you will see the light
        <br>When I see that hurt in your eyes
        <br>But if all you can see is the change in me
        <br>At least you will know He's alive

        <br>When you give your life to Jesus, You'll never be walking alone
        <br>When you give your life to Jesus
        <br>You've found the Truth, and Heaven forever is home, Come hear Him call...

        <br>You turned down the chance too many times
        <br>When the feeling wasn't right
        <br>Why do you drown in the darkness
        <br>When you can dance in the light

        <br>When you give your life to Jesus, You'll never be walking alone
        <br>When you give your life to Jesus
        <br>You've found the Truth, and Heaven forever is home; Come hear Him call...
